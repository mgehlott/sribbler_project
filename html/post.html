            One of the biggest challenges in software development is time.
            It’s something we can’t easily get more of, but linting can help us  
            make the most out of the time we have.
            JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by
             several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming
              language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
               It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape
               Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.
                With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without
                 reloading the page every time. 
            The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
